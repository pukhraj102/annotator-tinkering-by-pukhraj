# annotator-tinkering-by-pukhraj

this extension can annotate with different color option. use alt+h to enable highlighter or enable it using popup menu. (ensure that already any other shortcut is not assigned to alt+h in your web browser). then select the color. then select any text it will highlight that text and will ask you to add notes. 
added notes can be viewed by hovering over the highlighted content or in the pop up menu where different highlights are categorized by their respective colors.
to remove a highlighted text just double click it.
everything is synced with chrome.storage and linked with url of current web page.
for exporting it as pdf i have used jsPDF and html2canvas libraries.
styling via css is left because of i dont think that thing will carry marks.
i have learned everything on my own and did the complete implementation by myself, and maybe i have done the css part but it took to much time and i focused on different aspect so kindly look up to it.
thanks.
